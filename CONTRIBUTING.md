# Contributing 🎉

Hi there! We are thrilled that you'd like to contribute to this project. Your help is essential for keeping it great 🙌.

Contributions to this project are [released][contributions-under-repo] to the public under the project's open source license.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:
- Follow standards for style and code quality.
- Write tests (if applicable).
- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Write a [good commit message][commit-msg].
- All content, comments, pull requests and other contributions must comply with the [code of conduct][coc].

## Getting started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account][github-signup].
* Create a GitHub issue for your contribution, assuming one does not already exist.
  * Choose one of the templates and clearly describe the issue.
* Fork the repository on GitHub.
* Try to keep your local repository in a "rebased" state.

## Finding things to work on

Issues marked with [good first issue][good-first-issue] or [help wanted][help-wanted] are usually pretty self-contained and a good place to get started.

If you see any issues that are assigned to a particular person or have the `work in progress` label, that means
someone is currently working on that issue this issue in the next week or two.

Of course, feel free to create a new issue if you think something needs to be added or fixed.

## Making changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work `git checkout -b my-branch-name`.
  * This is usually the `main` branch.
  * Please avoid working directly on the `main` branch.

## Submitting changes
* Push changes to your fork.
* Submit a pull request.

At this point, you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests within three
business days (typically, one business day). We may suggest some changes, improvements or
alternatives.
